# Deltahacks 5 Project - FountainWorks

## About

FountainWorks is a website that we've built to help monitor the Water Fountains at McMaster University. It is primarily 
aimed for the Students and McMaster's Facilities Services. 

Some of the features we've developed for this website:
1. It keeps a track of all the water Fountains in a given building, and shows the current status for a given water fountain.
2. FountainWorks provides a report-page to allow users to submit a report for fault water fountains
3. FountainWorks uses a database to keep track of all the water fountains.
